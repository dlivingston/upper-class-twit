# Project: Upper Class Twit Of The Year

In case it escaped your attention, I have a prediliction for nameing my projects after lines or titles from Monty Python sketches. The how and why tends to be random and based on my own sense of whimsy.  

At any rate, this particular project started sometime around July 2014. I recieved a list of test criteria for seeing what I could do in PHP. Unfortunately I don't have the original requirements document, but the requirements were roughly as follows...   

- Take a provided .csv file and import it into an array  
- Take the array, and check for missing or incorrect data (ie. invalid email address, sql injections, etc.)  
- Import the array into a MySQL table  
- Display the MySQL data with a timestamp
